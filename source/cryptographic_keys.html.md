## Work (BB80AB21)

    Fingerprint: FF6E 6FFA C4CB 0727 38D0  E1EB 4E5F 28B9 BB80 AB21

## Private (D4BF0A41)

    Fingerprint: 116F BA82 9506 5A01 C3BC  7CC6 CF79 BF54 D4BF 0A41

These replace the older two keys and are both using a larger key size and SHA-256 instead of SHA-1.

[This blog post](http://ekaia.org/blog/2009/05/10/creating-new-gpgkey/) by Ana Beatriz Guerrero LÃ³pez was very clear on how to generate these new keys.
