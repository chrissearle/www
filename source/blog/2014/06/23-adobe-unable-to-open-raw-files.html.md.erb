title: Adobe - unable to open raw files

This is an issue I've been having since my previous iMac and Lightroom4/Photoshop CS5.

Photoshop simply can't open raw files.

## Machines

I've had this on my old iMac with Lightroom 4 and Photoshop CS5.

I currently have this on my current iMac with Lightroom 4 and Lightroom 5 with Photoshop CS6, Photoshop CC and now Photoshop CC 2014.

I also have it on my macbook pro with Lightroom 5, Photoshop CC and Photoshop CC 2014.

## Files

This affects DNG raw format files that are originally from:

* D700 (Nikon NEF)
* D4S (Nikon NEF)
* S100 (Canon CR2)
* X100S (Fuji RAF)

## Symptom

Open raw file from Lightroom in Photoshop. Photoshop starts but no image opens.

Non-raw files work fine. It's just raw.

I can also repeat this with bridge instead of Lightroom. Same error.

I also see strangeness in Adobe Photoshop -> Automate (photomerge and merge to HDR pro) - again - it can't open raw files.

## Cause?

I have no idea. The multiple machine issue makes me wonder if it's something to do with my account. Just guessing tho.

## What have I tried?

I've tried trashing my adobe prefs - no help. I tried installing on the macbook pro (clean osx install). This helped for about 10 minutes. Then back to the same issue.

Last thing I did was to uninstall every adobe app I had on my iMac then reinstall just those I currently use (Lightroom 5, Photoshop CC 2014, InDesign CC 2014). Still no help.

## Workaround

Currently I have to export from Lightroom as tiff to same folder, sync the folder to get the tiff into Lightroom and then open in Photoshop. Means that you lose a lot of the continuity, and means that the library is getting lots of odd duplicate tiff files.

## Next steps?

No idea :(

I've tried asking in the forums - no-one could give me a fix.

I've tried today using adobe's support help chat.

* Log in
* Help
* Chat
* Fill out the description in detail
* Submit
* Wait
* Wait
* Wait
* Get a "You're now talking to ..." and someone's name
* Then **instantly** over to "Chat is not currently available".

Rinse & repeat. Tried both chrome and firefox.
